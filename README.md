<h1>Generic gbXML Validator for Versio 6.01</h1>

This is an open-source C# project (web forms) that compares a gbXML file against the Version 6.01 XSD schema.
<br><Br>
This validator only checks for valid XML and does not do any type of test case validation. The source code also includes a C# class that represents the entire gbXML schema 6.01 (created using XSD.exe).
